# Working with FHIR using Eclipse

The purpose of this project is to create a place to keep several small Eclipse based tools used to support development of FHIR Implementation Guides in Eclipse.  The name comes really simply: What would really stands out during an Eclipse? A solar flare.

This repo includes some things that are outstanding<sup>*</sup> for working with FHIR IG Development in Eclipse.

NOTE: Code is coming soon...

## Launchers
Tools to launch the FHIR Build script and Sushi from within Eclipse on your IG Project

## Console Extensions
Support for hyperlinking from error messages generated by the launchers back to your IG source files.
This includes support for both the [FHIR IG Publisher](//github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher) and [Sushi](//github.com/FHIR/sushi) generation tools.

## Markers
Support for adding markers to your source files based on reported errors and warnings.
When you use one of the launchers, the console extension will automatically generate the markers for you.


<sup>*</sup> As in presently missing, we'll leave it to you with regard to an evaluation of their utility.
